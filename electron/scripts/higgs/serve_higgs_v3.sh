# Launch Higgs Audio v3 (4B) under vllm-omni.
#
# PROVENANCE. Transcribed from
#   E:\training\_campaigns\2026-09-01-cod-full-rebuild\higgs\serve_v3.sh
# (owens-pc, WSL Ubuntu, RTX 3090 Ti, 2026-09-04), which is the script every
# measurement in electron/data/higgs-models.json was taken against. What differs
# from the original, and why each one is a fix rather than drift:
#   1. The env prefix is a parameter ($HIGGS_ENV) instead of a hardcoded
#      /home/telltale path, so this ships.
#   2. The model is resolved from $HIGGS_MODEL_DIR when set, so a merged
#      fine-tune can be served without editing the script. narrator EXPORTS it
#      per voice (python/narrator/engine/higgs/v3_served.py `_launch_exports`).
#   3. Memory, concurrency and context length are passed PER STAGE through
#      --stage-overrides, not as global flags. vllm-omni applies a global
#      --gpu-memory-utilization / --max-num-seqs / --max-model-len to EVERY stage
#      (vllm_omni/config/omni_config.py `_stage_cli_overrides`: a field of
#      OmniEngineArgs is a "global stage field"), and this server is TWO stages -
#      the talker (stage 0) and the codec decoder (stage 1). The campaign's
#      `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.60` therefore reserved 0.60 of the card TWICE:
#      measured 24.2 GB of 24.5 GB in use on 2026-09-05. The deploy profile
#      (vllm_omni/deploy/higgs_multimodal_qwen3.yaml) intends 0.60 for the talker
#      and 0.25 for the codec, and that is what the two variables below default
#      to. Likewise `--max-model-len 8192` was clamping the codec stage, whose
#      profile value is 65536.
#   4. $HIGGS_DEPLOY_CONFIG selects vllm-omni's deploy profile, and BookForge now
#      SETS it - to the file the installer copies in beside this script,
#      <env>/bin/higgs_default_frames7500.yaml.
#      THAT PROFILE EXISTS BECAUSE THE SERVED SPEECH ENDPOINT IGNORES A
#      PER-REQUEST max_tokens. MEASURED 2026-09-05 (owens-pc, vllm-omni 0.28.0):
#      stage 0's `default_sampling_params.max_tokens` is a HARD CEILING on every
#      render, and the auto-discovered profile sets it to 2048 frames = 81.92 s,
#      so any chunk needing more audio than that is cut mid-sentence and no
#      request parameter can raise it. The shipped profile is byte-identical to
#      vllm-omni's own `higgs_multimodal_qwen3.yaml` EXCEPT max_tokens 7500
#      (300 s). Unset, vllm-omni auto-discovers its own file again and the
#      81.92 s ceiling is back - which is why this is set rather than left to a
#      default. (The sibling `higgs_multimodal_qwen3_low_latency.yaml` is a
#      different question - CUDA graphs on the talker - and is still uncertified.)
#   5. The attention backend is forced PER STAGE in --stage-overrides as well as
#      by the global --attention-backend flag. MEASURED (training, 2026-09-05):
#      when a deploy profile is passed EXPLICITLY, a stage-level
#      `attention_backend: FLASHINFER` in that profile can beat the global flag -
#      and FlashInfer cannot JIT on this box (the CUDA 13 nvcc from the pip wheel
#      rejects its bundled CCCL headers), so the global flag alone is not enough
#      to keep it out. Passing it in the stage override says it at the level the
#      profile says it at.
# The levers are documented in the campaign's HIGGS_V3_LEVERS.md.
#
# The installer copies this into <env>/bin/serve_higgs_v3.sh and chmod +x's it;
# the doctor checks that the copy there is byte-identical to the shipped one.
# Keeping it inside the env is what makes the stack self-contained: nothing at
# run time reads E:\training.

# Stage 0, the talker: weights + KV cache. Stage 1, the codec decoder: no KV
# cache. Both are FRACTIONS OF THE WHOLE CARD, and they add - and the sum must
# leave room for three CUDA contexts.
#
# THE TALKER'S FRACTION IS ITS KV CACHE BUDGET ON TOP OF THE WEIGHTS, not a cap
# on the stage. MEASURED 2026-09-05 (owens-pc, RTX 3090 Ti 24.5 GB, vllm-omni
# 0.28.0) at 0.35, from the server's own log: "Desired GPU memory utilization is
# (0.35, 8.4 GiB). Actual usage is 7.72 GiB", "Available KV cache memory:
# 8.4 GiB", "GPU KV cache size: 61,120 tokens" - so stage 0 holds 7.72 GiB of
# weights AND 8.4 GiB of cache. Reading the fraction as a ceiling is what made
# the earlier pairs overcommit the card:
#
#   0.60 + 0.25   24,274 MiB in use, the WDDM driver paging into shared system
#                 RAM, the render falling from ~8 to ~2 chunks/min, 2 GB free.
#   0.55 + 0.15   24.0 GB in use - still paging.
#   0.35 + 0.10   18.7-19.2 GB in use, and IDENTICAL THROUGHPUT at 16 concurrent:
#                 11,387-11,584 chars/min across three runs. Shipped.
#
# At 0.35 + 0.10, 32 concurrent filled the card and stalled, which is the other
# half of why HIGGS_MAX_NUM_SEQS ships at 16.

# can serve at all. That is also why changing voice means restarting this script
# (~55 s warm / ~300 s cold) rather than sending the server a message.
