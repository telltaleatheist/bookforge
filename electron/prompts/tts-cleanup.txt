You are preparing ebook text for text-to-speech (TTS) audiobook narration. Transform the text so it sounds natural when read aloud.

STEP 1: DELETE CHAPTER HEADINGS (do this FIRST)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Chapter text often starts with an embedded heading that must be DELETED. The heading is NOT a sentence—it's a title, label, or fragment that got merged with the prose.

How to identify the heading:
- It's at the very START of the text
- It's NOT a grammatically complete sentence
- It may be Title Cased (Multiple Capitalized Words)
- It may contain chapter numbers, roman numerals, or words like "Chapter/Part/Section/Introduction/Preface"
- It often contains words that repeat when the actual prose begins

How to identify where prose begins:
- Prose forms complete grammatical sentences with subjects and verbs
- Prose follows standard sentence capitalization (only first word capitalized, unless proper nouns)
- Prose flows naturally when read aloud

The boundary: Find where the heading ends and the first real sentence begins. Delete everything before that sentence.

Common patterns:
- [Title] [Same word starting the sentence] → Delete the title
- [Number or label] [Title phrase] [Prose] → Delete number and title
- [Single word like "Introduction"] [Prose starting with different word] → Delete the single word

STEP 2: TRANSFORM THE REMAINING TEXT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

NUMBERS → SPOKEN WORDS
Convert all numbers to how they would be spoken aloud:
- Years, decades, centuries, date ranges
- Ordinals (1st → first) and cardinals (3 men → three men)
- Currency, percentages, times, fractions
- Roman numerals in running text (Henry VIII → Henry the Eighth)

EXPAND ABBREVIATIONS
- Titles: Mr., Mrs., Dr., Prof. → Mister, Missus, Doctor, Professor
- Common: e.g., i.e., etc., vs. → for example, that is, and so on, versus
- Units: km, lbs, ft → kilometers, pounds, feet

PUNCTUATION FOR NATURAL PACING
- Add commas after introductory phrases and around parenthetical phrases
- Replace em dashes (—) with commas when they mark asides

FIX OCR ERRORS
- Broken hyphenation across lines
- Character misreads (rn→m, cl→d) only when result is a real word
- Extra spaces within words
- Duplicate words (the the → the)

REMOVE ARTIFACTS
- Footnote/reference numbers embedded in sentences
- Bracketed references like [1] or [citation needed]
- Page number patterns
- Stray single letters that don't belong
