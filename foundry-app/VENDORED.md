# foundry-app — a VENDORED subtree. Do not edit it here.

This directory is a mechanical copy of the Foundry desktop app's `app/` folder.
BookForge hosts the Foundry window inside its own process (the ruling in
Foundry's `docs/BOOKFORGE-HANDOFF.md` §8), and the copy is how that happens:
one authoritative repo, a mechanical copy, never a fork maintained by hand in
two places.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Source repo | `C:\Users\tellt\Projects\foundry` (branch `main`) |
| Source path | `app/` — the whole folder, source only |
| Source sha | **7e0bf21** — *"feat(app): first contact -- an import tells the host which project it minted"* |
| Copied on | 2026-08-16 |
| Copied by | `git -C <foundry> archive 7e0bf21 app \| tar -x --strip-components=1` |

The go-signal named `48f3a59` ("Wave 7 is complete"); `7e0bf21` is the commit
after it, which adds the optional `onImport` half of the host contract (four
files: `shared/types.ts`, `electron/{projects,host,mount}.ts`). BookForge wires
both halves, so the copy is taken from the later sha. `docs/IPC-CHANNELS.md` is
byte-identical between the two.

`IPC-CHANNELS.md` beside this file is `docs/IPC-CHANNELS.md` from the same sha —
it is not part of `app/`, it is carried along because it is the authority the
collision keeper (`tools/test-ipc-collision.js`) parses. Foundry's side has
committed to regenerating it from source on every wave.

## SEALED SUBTREE

**Edit in the Foundry repo and re-copy. Never here.** A fix made in this
directory is lost the next time the subtree is refreshed, and worse, it makes
the two copies disagree while both look authoritative. If something in here is
wrong, it is wrong in Foundry — say so on the message channel
(`C:\tmp\bookforge-to-foundry.md`) and take the next sha.

The one exception is this file, which is BookForge's own note about the copy.

## Refreshing it

```
cd C:\Users\tellt\Projects\foundry
git archive <new-sha> app > <scratch>\foundry-app.tar
# in BookForge:
rm -r foundry-app/electron foundry-app/shared foundry-app/src   # sources only
cd foundry-app && tar --force-local -xf <scratch>\foundry-app.tar --strip-components=1
git -C C:\Users\tellt\Projects\foundry show <new-sha>:docs/IPC-CHANNELS.md > foundry-app/IPC-CHANNELS.md
```

Then rebuild (below) and run `node tools/run-keepers.js` — the collision keeper
reads the refreshed `IPC-CHANNELS.md` and fails if a new Foundry channel name
now collides with one of BookForge's own.

## Building it — its own recipe, not BookForge's

The subtree keeps its own `package.json`, `angular.json` and `tsconfig*.json`,
its own `node_modules`, and its own Angular major (21, where BookForge is on its
own). BookForge's build does not compile a line of it; `tsconfig.electron.json`
and `tsconfig.app.json` are `include`-based and name only `electron/`,
`shared/`, `packages/quire/src/` and `src/` — this directory is outside all of
them, deliberately.

```
cd foundry-app
npm install
npm run build      # tsc -p tsconfig.electron.json  -> dist/electron + dist/shared
                   # ng build                       -> dist/renderer
```

`dist/` and `node_modules/` here are build output and are gitignored by the
subtree's own `.gitignore` (which came with the copy).

## What BookForge imports

Exactly one module, and it is imported at the TOP of `electron/main.ts`, before
anything that waits on app-ready:

```
foundry-app/dist/electron/mount.js
```

It registers the privileged `foundry-file://` scheme at import time, which
Electron refuses to do after `whenReady`. Importing it runs nothing else. Its
four exports are the whole seam: `mountFoundry(host?)`, `openFoundryWindow(dir?)`,
`stopFoundry()` and `hostedLibraryDir()`.

The host object BookForge hands to `mountFoundry` carries `libraryDir`,
`onExport(ExportLanding)` — a finished file landed in a project's `final/` — and
`onImport(ImportLanding)`, the optional first-contact announcement that tells the
host which project key Foundry minted for a file imported from outside the
library. Both are wired in `electron/main.ts`.

The compiled main-process code runs on **BookForge's** Electron. The subtree
declares `electron ^33` as a devDependency (types at build time, plus a binary
`npm install` fetches that nobody here runs) and BookForge is on Electron 33 —
they match, so the devDep is left exactly as Foundry ships it.
