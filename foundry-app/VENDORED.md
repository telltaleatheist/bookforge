# foundry-app — a VENDORED subtree. Do not edit it here.

This directory is a mechanical copy of the Foundry desktop app's `app/` folder.
BookForge hosts the Foundry window inside its own process (the ruling in
Foundry's `docs/BOOKFORGE-HANDOFF.md` §8), and the copy is how that happens:
one authoritative repo, a mechanical copy, never a fork maintained by hand in
two places.

| Source repo | `C:\Users\tellt\Projects\foundry` (branch `main`) |
| Source path | `app/` — the whole folder, source only |

The go-signal named `48f3a59` ("Wave 7 is complete"); `7e0bf21` added the
optional `onImport` half of the host contract, `c805bd6` added the
`foundryBusy()` export that gates BookForge's library-move door, and `4071d77`
added the `opts.document` deep-link so an Open button lands ON a file (same
admission rules as a drop). `6a9d31c` brought Owen's first-smoke fixes:
`74c20c8` (hosted, the dev-checkout engine fallback refuses out loud),
`911eab9` (the aligned view says "simplification" when the pass was a
simplify), `82a3763` (hosted, closing the last tab closes the window instead
of falling through to Foundry Home — this one added the `window:close`
channel, the first channel change since the copy began), and `6a9d31c` itself
(a project opens showing the latest change its position names, not the
original file). `ec1edda` brought the queue-rebuild pair: `e8b0399` — the
HOST-OPERATIONS SOCKET (`mountFoundry({hostOperations})`, `setHostNodes()`,
the `host-ops:` channel family — three handles and one push, a family
BookForge owns nothing in, so collision-safety is structural) — and
`ec1edda` itself, the provenance-tree redesign (cards on a drawn spine,
plain-sentence titles, host nodes drawn in the same grammar; the composer
of Owen's pipeline ruling). `6925d21` brought Owen's viewer rewrite: `7f7bd8e`
(a contents entry pointing inside a chapter is a heading, not a division),
`e6a736c` (the register stands above the paper), `7d34935` (chapter marker at
the hand — an X on the rule, right-click starts one), `370fafc` (ONE VIEWER,
NO TABS — columns, strips and pins retire), `218f0b2` (TabsService becomes
five services), `1858041` (Compare — a second read-only column locked to a
chosen step), `7eb10da` (Wave 6 closes), and `6925d21` itself (the book
scrolls again). `a32c087` is HOST-OPS ROUND 2, the whole delta from 6925d21
in one commit: `ExportLanding.stepId` (exports know their ledger step, also
in project.json final[] rows), host ops offered on export rows, the in-window
form dialog (`HostOperationOffer.form: HostOpField[]`, `invoke` grew a third
`settings` arg — two-arg hosts keep working), nav-rail buttons for formed
'book' ops, failed nodes withhold chaining ops (CHAINABLE_FROM table) and
render Retry/Dismiss when the host registers `FoundryHost.onNodeAction`
(new handle `host-ops:node-action`; 69 total). `host-ops:offers` now answers
`{operations, nodeActions}`. `1c7d6c9` is Owen's per-stage ruling ("the only
options that exist are the ones that are possible for that stage"), Wave 10:
`NodeOutput` grew `'export'` — export rows produce it, ledger steps never do,
`offeredFrom` stays one comparison — so BookForge's narrate moved to
`appliesTo: 'export'` in the SAME commit as this refresh (at 1c7d6c9 a narrate
still saying 'book' would draw on steps only, the exact inverse of the
ruling); Foundry's own offers now gate per act on shared possibility
predicates (new `shared/stages.ts`), and the delta also carried `0fc3bfd`
(docs-only date corrections). Each refresh changed only the files its commits
name and was hash-verified against the source tree (94/94 blobs at 1c7d6c9).

`IPC-CHANNELS.md` beside this file is `docs/IPC-CHANNELS.md` from the same sha —
it is not part of `app/`, it is carried along because it is the authority the
collision keeper (`tools/test-ipc-collision.js`) parses. Foundry's side has
committed to regenerating it from source on every wave.

## SEALED SUBTREE

**Edit in the Foundry repo and re-copy. Never here.** A fix made in this
directory is lost the next time the subtree is refreshed, and worse, it makes
the two copies disagree while both look authoritative. If something in here is
wrong, it is wrong in Foundry — say so on the message channel
(`E:\agent-bridge\bookforge-to-foundry.md`) and take the next sha.

The one exception is this file, which is BookForge's own note about the copy.

## Refreshing it

```
cd C:\Users\tellt\Projects\foundry
git archive <new-sha> app > <scratch>\foundry-app.tar
# in BookForge:
rm -r foundry-app/electron foundry-app/shared foundry-app/src   # sources only
cd foundry-app && tar --force-local -xf <scratch>\foundry-app.tar --strip-components=1
git -C C:\Users\tellt\Projects\foundry show <new-sha>:docs/IPC-CHANNELS.md > foundry-app/IPC-CHANNELS.md
```

Then rebuild (below) and run `node tools/run-keepers.js` — the collision keeper
reads the refreshed `IPC-CHANNELS.md` and fails if a new Foundry channel name
now collides with one of BookForge's own.

## Building it — its own recipe, not BookForge's

The subtree keeps its own `package.json`, `angular.json` and `tsconfig*.json`,
its own `node_modules`, and its own Angular major (21, where BookForge is on its
own). BookForge's build does not compile a line of it; `tsconfig.electron.json`
and `tsconfig.app.json` are `include`-based and name only `electron/`,
`shared/`, `packages/quire/src/` and `src/` — this directory is outside all of
them, deliberately.

```
cd foundry-app
npm install
npm run build      # tsc -p tsconfig.electron.json  -> dist/electron + dist/shared
                   # ng build                       -> dist/renderer
```

`dist/` and `node_modules/` here are build output and are gitignored by the
subtree's own `.gitignore` (which came with the copy).

## What BookForge imports

Exactly one module, and it is imported at the TOP of `electron/main.ts`, before
anything that waits on app-ready:

```
foundry-app/dist/electron/mount.js
```

It registers the privileged `foundry-file://` scheme at import time, which
Electron refuses to do after `whenReady`. Importing it runs nothing else. The
seam's exports: `mountFoundry(host?)`, `openFoundryWindow(dir?)`,
`stopFoundry()`, `hostedLibraryDir()`, and — since ec1edda — `setHostNodes()`
plus the `HostOperation`/`HostNode` types for the host-operations socket
(`hostOperations` rides in on the host object).

The host object BookForge hands to `mountFoundry` carries `libraryDir`,
`onExport(ExportLanding)` — a finished file landed in a project's `final/` — and
`onImport(ImportLanding)`, the optional first-contact announcement that tells the
host which project key Foundry minted for a file imported from outside the
library. Both are wired in `electron/main.ts`.

The compiled main-process code runs on **BookForge's** Electron. The subtree
declares `electron ^33` as a devDependency (types at build time, plus a binary
`npm install` fetches that nobody here runs) and BookForge is on Electron 33 —
they match, so the devDep is left exactly as Foundry ships it.
