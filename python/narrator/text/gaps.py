"""THE GAP CLASSIFIER: how much silence sits either side of one chunk.

Moved here from `engine/orpheus/prompt.py` on 2026-09-04, BODY UNCHANGED, because
two callers now need it and they may not import each other:

  `engine/orpheus/prompt.py`  bakes the answer into every Orpheus FLAC
                              (`_classify_gap` -> `_save_audio`), which is why an
                              Orpheus session needs no gap file at all.
  `text/prep.py`              WRITES the answer to
                              `chapters/sentences/gaps.json` for a pads=False
                              engine, whose audio carries no silence of its own.

WHY IT MOVED INTO `text/` RATHER THAN BEING IMPORTED OUT OF `engine/`. The
dependency has to point one way, and `text/` is the lower layer: it is pure
stdlib, it must import on a machine with no torch, and `narrator.engine` pulls
in `narrator.engine.orpheus` at package import. `assemble/` already refuses to
import an engine for exactly this reason (`assemble/engine_profiles.py`: "assembly
runs without importing an engine"). So the pure function lives at the bottom and
the Orpheus mixin calls down to it; `PromptMixin._classify_gap` is now a
one-line delegate and every `self._classify_gap(...)` call site is untouched.

THE FUNCTION BELOW IS VERBATIM. It was lifted mechanically (dedent one level,
drop `self`) rather than retyped, so its comments, its numbers and its 2026-07-17
ruling are exactly what the engine has been running.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR gaps.json, and it is worth saying plainly because it is not
what a reader expects: at 9daab0ba there are NO per-kind tiers left. A heading,
a paragraph `[break]`, an `[item]`, a `[silence]` and a bare sentence end ALL
return `(0.0, sentence_gap)`. The paragraph and section tiers were removed on
2026-07-17 - they were measured as purely additive dead air on top of a model
that already reproduces the narrator's own pausing - and the only thing that
still moves the answer is an EXPLICIT `[pause:X]`. So a gaps.json is mostly one
repeated value, and that is correct, not a bug in the writer.

    """Inter-clip silence for a chunk. Returns (lead_gap_sec, trail_gap_sec).

    2026-07-17 - AUTO PARAGRAPH/SECTION GAPS REMOVED FOR ORPHEUS (deliberately).
    Root cause of the long-standing "dialogue has huge pauses" complaint: e2a's
    SHARED text prep rewrites EVERY blank line to a valueless [pause] token, and
    prose puts EVERY dialogue turn in its own blank-line-separated paragraph. The
    old three-tier logic here then stamped a deterministic SECTION gap (1.0-1.6s
    lead) on top of each turn's sentence-gap tail. Measured with auto-editor on
    the mistborn 0.6s-cap model: dialogue-turn gaps were 2.0-2.5s (13 of them, one
    per paragraph break) vs the narrator's own ~0.6-1.0s; a STRAIGHT-NARRATION
    render from the same model measured median 0.57s / max 1.17s with NO outliers
    - i.e. the Orpheus model, trained on clips that keep their natural
    inter-sentence pauses (only the clip EDGES trimmed), already reproduces the
    narrator's pausing itself. The paragraph/section insertion was therefore
    PURELY additive dead air.

    So for Orpheus we now keep ONLY:
      - the sentence-gap FLOOR on every chunk's tail (each chunk is a separate
        generation whose trailing silence is trimmed, so without a small floor the
        chunks butt together), and
      - an EXPLICIT [pause:X] (intentional, markup-specified beat) - still honored,
        because that's a deliberate pause, not the auto blank-line noise.
    The auto valueless [pause] (blank line) and [break]/[silence] (<p>/<br>) tiers
    are GONE. The tokens themselves still drive chunk boundaries in the packer and
    are stripped by _clean_sentence_for_tts before TTS - only their deterministic
    GAP is removed here.

    If a real scene/section break ever under-pauses as a result, re-introduce a
    section tier HERE (or emit an explicit [pause:X] at that break) - do NOT
    restore the blanket blank-line gap that caused the dialogue problem.
