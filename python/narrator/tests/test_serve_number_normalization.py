"""`normalize_for_tts` - the listen path's number reading, and its refusals.

This runs on every `generate` and every streamed batch row, which is the browser
extension's path. (The audiobook path normalizes upstream in BookForge and never
arrives here.) It used to be built entirely out of fallbacks:

    _HAS_NUM2WORDS          a missing module read "$5.50" as punctuation, silently
    except Exception: ...   five sites returned the raw digits, silently
    (language or 'en')      a blank language narrated as English, silently

All three are gone. What replaces them is the point of this module: a refusal
that NAMES the thing it could not say, ONCE per request rather than once per
sentence - because the likeliest cause (a language num2words has no module for)
is a property of the session, and failing every digit-bearing sentence
separately with the same message is N refusals for one cause.
