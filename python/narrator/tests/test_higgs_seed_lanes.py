"""A chunk's seed is a function of (index, take) and nothing else.

THE LADDER'S WHOLE PREMISE (training PC, 2026-09-21, relayed from Owen): cell
`(prompt, take)` must be comparable across checkpoints, so four takes are four
matched lanes on every model. With `retake: false` the plan pins `attempt` to 0
and the seed is `seed + index` shifted into the take's lane (`in_take_lane`) —
and since 2026-09-20 an unjudged batch goes through the engine's batched driver
with the job's `width`. These tests pin the invariant that batching must not
bend: the seed a chunk renders at does not depend on batch position, batch
size, completion order, or the order rows were handed in.

Driven through the Higgs fake, which applies the real arms' rule word for word
(`FakeHiggsEngine._seed_for` / `_request_seed` mirror `HiggsV3Engine`'s and
`HiggsV3MlxEngine`'s) and records the seed each render ACTUALLY drew at. The
assertion is on what was applied, never on what was asked for.
