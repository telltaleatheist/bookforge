"""An unjudged batch is still a BATCH — `retake: false` without a GPU.

MEASURED ON THE TRAINING PC, 2026-09-20, and this is the defect these tests
exist for. `serve/worker.py` picked the engine's batched driver `if rows and
retake:` and a sequential comprehension otherwise, so ONE flag decided two
unrelated things: whether the batch was judged, and whether it was batched at
all. A 128-chunk render at width 4 — `HIGGS_MAX_NUM_SEQS=4` exported, sglang
demonstrably willing (zero rejections across 1,024 renders at concurrency 4 on
the same checkpoint, direct) — sat at `#running-req: 1` on all 684 sampled
scheduler lines: 12.9 s/chunk against 4.16 s/render direct.

It fell on the caller who could least afford it. A screening render of a
fine-tuned checkpoint MUST send `retake: false` — it has no measured band, and
measuring one is what the render is for — so the one client rendering a thousand
chunks for throughput was the one client guaranteed to get them one at a time.

THE FIX IS A PLAN, NOT A POOL. `truncation.UnjudgedPlan` has `GuardPlan`'s exact
driver surface and judges nothing, so `render_many` stays the one driver and the
width is spent by the ENGINE — `v3_engine` pools threads, `mlx_backend` groups
into a BatchGenerator. A thread pool in the worker would have been right for the
served arm and wrong for MLX.

`GuardPlan(tracker=None)` is NOT this and the difference is the whole point: it
falls back to a fixed band and still judges, which for a screening checkpoint
means judging it against another model's numbers.
