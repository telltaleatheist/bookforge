"""`narrator.serve.worker`'s environment knobs: the refusals, and the OWNER.

TWO DEFECTS, ONE FILE, because they are two halves of the same rule
(crucible/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md R1: one fact, one owner, and where a copy must
exist it is CHECKED rather than authored twice).

**1. GARBAGE WAS COERCED TO A DEFAULT.** Four reads in `serve/worker.py` - the
stream gap (since deleted, see below), the warm-up's `n` and `ramp`, and the
grouping `cap` - sat behind
`except (TypeError, ValueError): <the default>` and `if x < 1: x = 1`.
`ORPHEUS_STREAM_BATCH='1 6'` (a stray space) therefore rendered every Listen
batch 16 wide on a box tuned for 4, and nothing said so. The same package
already had the opposite policy written down and enforced, in
`engine/higgs/mlx_backend.py`'s `_env_number`, whose docstring is the ruling:
"Garbage is never coerced and never defaulted past... 'it fell back to the
default' is exactly the sentence nobody can debug." One policy, two answers,
nothing comparing them. That function is now `narrator/env.py:env_number` and
both sides call it.

**2. TWO OF THE DEFAULTS ARE NOT NARRATOR'S TO CHOOSE.**
`electron/orpheus-worker-pool.ts` owns the streaming width and the ramp
(`STREAM_BATCH_CEILING_DEFAULT`, `STREAM_RAMP_WIDTH`) and sets both on every
serve spawn it makes, so narrator's numbers are a SECOND COPY - live only for a
worker started without that spawn (`python -m narrator.serve`, the CLI, these
tests), and free to drift silently otherwise. They are read out of the
TypeScript here and asserted equal, the way
`test_engine_protocol.test_the_engines_agree_with_the_assemblers_own_table`
holds the assembler's copy of `pads`/`edge_fade` to the engines'.

**THE THIRD KNOB IS GONE (2026-09-18).** `ORPHEUS_STREAM_GAP` used to be here as
the one default that WAS narrator's own - 0.3 s of silence appended to every
streamed row. It is deleted with the padding: the gap between two Listen rows is
`text/gaps.classify_gap`'s answer for the row, stated on the wire as `gapSec` and
inserted by the PLAYER, so the number has one owner and it is the same one the
book uses. What is pinned about it lives in
`test_engine_serve_protocol.py` (the field, per row) rather than here, because
there is no longer an environment variable to have an opinion about.
