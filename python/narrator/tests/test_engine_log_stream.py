"""The engine's log lines must never land on a host's STRUCTURED stdout.

THE BUG (measured 2026-09-05, Higgs v3 through `python -m narrator.serve` on
the Mac):

    RuntimeError: non-JSON on stdout: '[HIGGS-MLX] loading Higgs v3 from ...'

`narrator.serve`'s stdout IS the JSON-lines protocol. The engine layer had 94
bare `print` calls, every one of which could land between two protocol messages.

AND WHY "MOVE THEM ALL TO STDERR" IS THE WRONG FIX - the half this file exists
to stop anyone undoing. `electron/parallel-tts-bridge.ts` spawns
`narrator.compat.worker` and its worker **stdout** handler runs five parsers its
**stderr** handler does not:

    MODEL_LOAD_START_RE   /Loading Orpheus model with/    the load bar starting
    MODEL_LOAD_DONE_RE    /model loaded!/                 the load bar finishing
    REPAIR_START_RE       /hit the MLX audio-token cap/   the re-split ladder bar
    parseMlxHeartbeat()   "[ORPHEUS] MLX batch generating: ..."   the batch bar
    parseOrpheusGuardEvent()                              the guard-event index

Every one of those strings is printed by `engine/orpheus/`. So the stream is the
HOST's to choose, and the two hosts choose differently. Both directions are
pinned below, because each one silently breaks a different product surface.

NO STRING IS UNDER TEST HERE except as a destination: the rewrite that created
`log()` changed 94 call names and not one character of any message, and
`test_the_bridges_stdout_only_patterns_still_match` proves the exact strings the
bridge greps for are still emitted verbatim.
