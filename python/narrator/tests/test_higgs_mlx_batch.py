"""Higgs v3 on MLX, WIDER THAN ONE ROW: the ceiling, the budget, the slicing.

WHAT THIS FILE CAN PROVE, AND WHAT IT CANNOT.

Provable here, on any machine, with no model and no GPU:

  * the three environment variables - their defaults, and that garbage is
    REFUSED BY NAME rather than coerced or defaulted past;
  * the memory arithmetic: headroom = budget - weights - the PINNED buffer
    cache, and width = headroom / (depth x MB-per-position-per-row), clamped to
    [1, ceiling];
  * the slicing: consecutive book-order slices, each carrying its own depth
    (prompt positions + that row's frame cap), and an over-deep slice split
    EVENLY rather than into [allowed, remainder];
  * that a ceiling of 1 still takes the serial path, chunk by chunk;
  * the LISTEN ladder's shape: streamed rows solo and first, the read-ahead
    batched behind them, on_chunk only where it was asked for, on_row exactly
    once per completed row, and a failed group raising rather than retrying;
  * that `on_retire` hands a row over the moment it retires, against a fake
    sampler - the row bookkeeping, not the audio;
  * that none of the names this backend reads is an ORPHEUS_ one - the Higgs
    spawn strips those deliberately, and a keeper on the TypeScript side asserts
    none rides along.

NOT provable here: that a batched render sounds like a single-row one. That is a
GPU measurement on the Mac - the left-padded prefill, the per-row retirement and
the cache `filter(keep)` are mirrored from mlx-audio's own `batch_generate`, and
nothing in this file loads a model. Owen measures it.

# THE SERIAL ARM OF THE GUARDED DRIVER: render_many at width 1
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `BATCH_SIZE` defaults to 1 on this backend (see the constant: "Unset means 1 -
# one row at a time, byte for byte the behaviour that shipped"), so
# `_render_many_serial` is the arm a Mac actually runs when narrator.serve - and
# therefore Crucible - asks it to render. Nothing reached it before 2026-09-13:
# `convert_batch` at a ceiling of 1 short-circuits to `convert` (which drives
# `truncation.render_guarded`, not this), and no other caller existed - so the
# driver Owen's ruling lifted above the file-writing layer shipped untested on
# its own default width.
#
# What these prove is the CONTRACT of crucible/docs/PHASE6-REMOTE-RENDER.md
# sections 2, 3 and 5: one requested index gives exactly one artifact whatever
# the ladder did to it, the verdict travels with the audio as DATA (a client on
# the far end of a socket has no shared stderr to scrape the
# `[HIGGS3][HIGGS_GUARD_EVENT]` lines off), and not one file is written.


class _SerialRenders:
    """`render_audio`, stubbed: one silent waveform per call at a chosen pace.

    THE TRAP THIS EXISTS TO AVOID is the one `serve/fake_engine.py` documents
    above `_rate_for`: a stub whose audio length is exactly proportional to its
    character count can NEVER fire the guard, because every take then sits at one
    identical chars/sec and the band is a ratio test. So the pace is a per-chunk
    TABLE - chars/sec for take 0, take 1, ... with the last entry repeating - and
    the guard fires, or does not, because the arithmetic says so.

    TWO RULES, both `_rate_for`'s, both load-bearing:
      * a SPLIT HALF IS NEVER BENT. Its text differs from the chunk's, so it
        renders at the clean pace and the split rung terminates - a table that
        bent the children too would drive every split to MAX_DEPTH and prove
        something other than what the test says it proves.
      * the attempt counter advances only on the chunk's OWN text, so a child
        render cannot eat the re-roll's entry.

    The waveform is zeros: `truncation.interior_hole_seconds` reports 0.0 for an
    all-silent take (`len(loud) < 2` - the silence touches both ends, so there is
    no INTERIOR run), which keeps the hole guard out of the way of the length
    arithmetic these tests are about.

    failed': THE MAC FAILED A BOOK WHERE THE PC FAILED A SENTENCE.
