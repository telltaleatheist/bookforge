"""THE PER-ITEM SAMPLING CHANNEL - one spelling, one validator, one pair of
refusal names.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (Owen, 2026-09-14, docs/EXTENSION-TO-CRUCIBLE-PLAN.md
section 2): *a retake must not reuse the settings that produced the problem;
the spread IS the take ladder.* Crucible's take ladder
(crucible/docs/PHASE3-TTS.md section 3) is a per-VOICE list of rungs, take 0
being the boson default 0.8 / 0.95 / 50 and take N > 0 a measured alternative
with a written reason. A `tts` job carries `take: N` and nothing else about
sampling: Crucible resolves the rung and sends the NUMBERS; narrator renders
that chunk under them.

Until now it could not. narrator's sampling arrived through the voices
document (`NARRATOR_HIGGS_VOICES`), which is written per LOAD, and
`generate` / `generate_batch` took no sampling at all - so Crucible refused
every rung above 0 by name (`sampling_not_wired`, PHASE3-TTS section 4: "a
rung is per RENDER and narrator's `generate_batch` takes no sampling, so a
ladder has no channel yet"). A reload per take is not a ladder. This is the
channel.

THE SPELLING IS THE VOICES DOCUMENT'S, DELIBERATELY. The document's `sampling`
block is `{temperature, topP, topK}` (+ `repetitionPenalty` on the served arm)
- `engine/higgs/config.py:_SAMPLING_KEYS`, and PHASE3-TTS section 4's table
spells it the same way for the `[voice.backends.<arm>].sampling` it is written
from. A second spelling on the per-item wire would be two names for one fact,
which is the exact shape crucible/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's audit found seven
times. So the wire key is the document key, and `WIRE_KEYS` below is the one
translation to the engines' snake_case.

A RUNG IS AN OVERLAY, NOT A REPLACEMENT, and that is measured rather than
tidy. `[[voice.takes]]` take 1 in PHASE3-TTS is one line, `temperature = 0.7`;
it says nothing about top_p or top_k because it means "take 0, but cooler". If
a partial rung REPLACED the voice's sampling, that rung would render with
top_k unset - and on SGLang-Omni an unset top_k is the untruncated 1026-way
codebook tail, measured 2026-09-05 as one chunk running to the cap with 80 s
of silence (`engine/higgs/sgl_served.py:_WHY_SAMPLING_IS_REQUIRED`). So each
engine applies an item's keys OVER its resolved sampling, key by key, and a
key the rung omits keeps take 0's value. `apply_over` is the one place that
happens.

THE TWO REFUSALS, both by name and neither ever a clamp:

  sampling_malformed      the item's `sampling` is not an object, is empty,
                          names a key that is not a lever, or carries a value
                          that is not a positive number (top_k: not a whole
                          one). The field is named in the message.
  sampling_not_supported  the value is well formed and this engine cannot
                          honour it - the lever does not exist on this backend
                          (mlx-audio has no repetition penalty), or the engine
                          has no per-item sampling at all (Orpheus, deprecated).

ABSENT IS NOT A REFUSAL AND NOT A FALLBACK. An item with no `sampling` key
renders at the voice's loaded default, which is take 0. That is the documented
meaning of "no rung", not a value substituted for a missing one.
