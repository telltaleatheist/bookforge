"""What a Higgs engine is built from, and every number the audition measured.

Sources (all read-only): the campaign
`E:\\training\\_campaigns\\2026-09-01-cod-full-rebuild\\higgs\\` - `render_v2.py`
(the measured render path), `smoke_v2.py` (the processor probe),
`v2_pokemon_para_log.json` (the nine-chunk audition), `HIGGS_NOTES.md` (the
template, the token ids, the licence) and `HIGGS_V3_LEVERS.md` (the v3 lever
sweep, which is DESIGN input here - v3 is not built).

THE VOICE IS CLIPS, AND CLIPS COME FROM A FILE. Orpheus's voice is a token that
rides in the prompt, so its whole configuration is a string. Higgs's voice is
reference clips WITH BOOK-EXACT TRANSCRIPTS, which is too much to put on a
command line and must not be guessed, so it is a JSON document named by
`NARRATOR_HIGGS_VOICES`:

    {
      "deathstalker": {
        "scene": "Audio is recorded from a quiet room.",
        "clips": [
          {"path": "/home/telltale/xtts_ft/ds_ad4s/wavs/cd_cd_00000008.wav",
           "transcript": "The purpose here is not sectarian, ...",
           "seconds": 14.02}
        ]
      }
    }

A load for a voice the file does not carry FAILS, naming the file and the
voices it does carry. There is no default voice: rendering a book in the
model's own narrator instead of the one asked for is a silent failure.

    the weights, `config.json`, `tokenizer.json`, `tokenizer_config.json`,
    `chat_template.jinja` AND **`generation_config.json`**. That last one is the
    SAMPLING the model is served at - `vllm-omni serve` resolves sampling from
    the model directory (`--generation-config auto`), and a dir without it falls
    back to a bare SamplingParams (top_p 1.0, top_k disabled) which derails long
    chunks into babble. `v3_served.require_generation_config` refuses a

                                               test or a demo. 12 % of the

    THERE IS NO 'adapter' SHAPE, and `adapterDir` is refused by name. vllm-omni
    cannot load a LoRA at runtime (no adapter flags; the talker does not
    implement `SupportsLoRA`), so there is nothing for an adapter directory to
    be loaded INTO. The LoRA is the archival artifact; what narrator serves is
    the merged checkpoint.

    A `clips` key that is present must hold at least one usable clip -
    `ClipsVoice` enforces that - so a clone whose references went missing is

    AN ADAPTER VOICE WITHOUT `maxChars` IS REFUSED. A fine-tune is tuned: its
    safe chunk length is a measured property of THAT model, and packing it at
    the base model's placeholder is a whole book packed for a model that no
    longer exists. This mirrors `OrpheusBudget.max_chars`, which refuses a
    catalog payload with no `maxChars` for the same reason. A plain clips voice
    (zero-shot, base weights) may use the engine's placeholder, and says so
