"""The Higgs audio codec: 8 codebooks at 25 fps, a delay pattern, 24 kHz.

Geometry, measured 2026-09-04 (`HIGGS_NOTES.md` section A, campaign
`2026-09-01-cod-full-rebuild/higgs`) and IDENTICAL in v2 and v3:

    8 codebooks, codebook_size 1024, audio vocab 1026 (1024 codes + stream
    bos 1024 / eos 1025); 25 frames per second (40 ms per frame); output
    24 000 Hz mono float32. 24000 / 25 = 960 samples per frame.

FROM THE MODEL'S OUTPUT TO A WAVEFORM. `model.generate` returns the WHOLE audio
stream as a (batch, seq, 8) matrix - the reference clips' frames and the newly
generated ones together. The steps below reproduce transformers'
`processing_higgs_audio_v2.batch_decode`, enumerated in HIGGS_NOTES.md, with one
addition marked (BF):

  1. find the LAST row whose 8 entries all equal 1024 (stream BOS): that is where
     generation starts, so everything before it - the references - is dropped.
  2. find the FIRST row after it whose 8 entries all equal 1025 (stream EOS):
     that is the end. No EOS -> the end of the sequence.
  3. slice (bos, eos): THE BOS ROW ITSELF IS DROPPED.
  4. revert the delay pattern: codebook c is delayed by c positions, so audio
     frame t of codebook c sits at stream position t + c. Reverting takes the
     diagonals and leaves `frames - (8 - 1)` = `frames - 7` frames. This is the
     only trim the shipped code does.
  4a. (BF, measured 2026-09-04) DROP THE TRAILING SENTINEL RUN, BY CONTENT. The
     model's ramp-down BOC/EOC sentinels smear over the last 7 frames because of
     the same delay; step 5 then maps them to code 0, WHICH IS A VALID CODE THAT
     DECODES TO SOUND. Heard as "a stray syllable after each sentence" - a
     100-160 ms burst rising from the noise floor to about -30 dB. vllm-omni
     defines `_filter_real_code_frames()` for exactly this and never calls it,
     and trims one frame (40 ms) where ~7 are contaminated. Trimming by CONTENT
     (drop trailing frames holding any out-of-range code) removes exactly the
     contaminated tail and cannot eat real speech the way a blind 7-frame trim
     could. It must run BEFORE step 5, or the sentinels are already 0 and
     invisible.
  5. clip to [0, 1023] so any stray sentinel is a legal codebook index.
  6. hand (1, 8, frames) to the audio tokenizer's decoder -> 1-D float32 at
     24 kHz.

Even after 4a a chunk edge sits near -30 dB and clicks on a join, which is what
`HiggsEngine.edge_fade_ms` (10 ms) is for: the ASSEMBLER fades it to -45..-48 dB.
No pads, no fades and no trimming are applied at either end here - Higgs emits
bare speech and the gaps are the assembler's (`Engine.pads` is False).

Steps 1-5 are pure numpy and are unit-tested with a FAKE decoder; only step 6
needs the model.
