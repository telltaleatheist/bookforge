"""Higgs TTS 3 (`higgs-audio-v3-tts-4b`) as a SERVED backend.

Higgs v3 is narrator's second engine (Owen, 2026-09-04 evening). It does NOT run
in this process: `model_type: higgs_multimodal_qwen3` has no HF modeling class -
it is implemented inside vllm-omni - and its dependency set (torch 2.13.0+cu130,
vllm 0.28.0) cannot share an environment with Orpheus's vLLM 0.7.3. So something
must LAUNCH a server, wait for its health endpoint, use it over HTTP, and kill
it. That lifecycle is `BackendSpec.kind == 'served'` and it is what this module
implements.

EVERY FACT BELOW IS MEASURED, from the campaign
`E:\\training\\_campaigns\\2026-09-01-cod-full-rebuild\\higgs\\`: `serve_v3.sh`
(the launch), `work/render_final.py` + `work/confirm.py` (the request),
`work/patch_vllm.py` + `work/patch_sentinel_filter.py` (the two required
patches),
`HIGGS_V3_LEVERS.md` (the lever sweep, the delivered render, the control-token
vocabulary), `work/refs/manifest.json` (the reference clips) and
`work/serve_v3c.log` (the route table).

THE ENVIRONMENT (owens-pc, WSL Ubuntu, RTX 3090 Ti)

    env      /home/telltale/anaconda3/envs/higgs3 (python 3.11,
             torch 2.13.0+cu130, vllm 0.28.0, vllm-omni 0.28.0)
    launch   BookForge's serve_higgs_v3.sh (transcribed from the campaign's
             serve_v3.sh) - vllm-omni serve <model dir> --served-model-name
             higgs-v3 --host/--port --trust-remote-code --stage-overrides
             <per-stage memory / max_num_seqs / max_model_len>
             --attention-backend FLASH_ATTN --omni, with CUDA_HOME pointed at
             the pip CUDA 13 wheel, VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER=0,
             VLLM_DISABLE_FLASHINFER_PREFILL=1, TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=8.6.
             The model dir, the bind address and the concurrency come from
             the HIGGS_* variables narrator exports (`_launch_exports`).
             PER-STAGE, not the global flags the campaign used: vllm-omni
             applies a global --gpu-memory-utilization to EVERY stage, and
             this server is two of them (talker + codec), so 0.60 reserved
             1.2 cards - measured 24.2 of 24.5 GB on 2026-09-05.
    cost     COLD START 55-297 s to health=200 (measured on this box, same
             script, same env: 55 s warm page cache, 146 s, and 297 s cold, in
             narrator's own smoke). The spread is disk and first-run
             compilation. The server preallocates to the utilization target
             (0.60 of 24 GB), so it OWNS the GPU while up.
    stop     SIGTERM the `vllm-omni serve` process (their work/release_gpu.sh
             does exactly this and then drops the shared lock)

narrator INVOKES THEIR SCRIPT. It does not write a launcher of its own: the
script is where the CUDA_HOME/flashinfer workarounds live, and a second copy of
them would drift.

TWO SITE-PACKAGES PATCHES ARE REQUIRED, and must be RE-APPLIED AFTER ANY PIP
UPGRADE in that env:

  work/patch_vllm.py       vLLM 0.28 rejects any prompt id < 0; vllm-omni's
                           clone path deliberately emits AUDIO_PLACEHOLDER_ID
                           == -100 for the talker to substitute reference
                           embeddings at prefill. Without the patch EVERY clone
                           request is HTTP 400 "Token id -100 is out of
                           vocabulary" - which is what made cloning look broken
                           in the first audition.
  work/patch_sentinel_filter.py
                           filters frames by TOKEN IDENTITY: a frame is kept iff
                           all 8 codebooks are in [0, 1023]. THIS IS
                           SERVER-SIDE. Upstream substituted every out-of-range
                           code with 0 - a VALID codec code that decodes to real
                           sound, so the substitution CONVERTED the ramp-down
                           BOC/EOC sentinels into audio - and then trimmed
                           exactly one of the seven frames they smear across,
                           leaving ~240 ms of garbage on every chunk. The patch
                           removes the substitution and the positional trim
                           entirely (`[:, :-1]` occurs twice in the pristine
                           file and zero times after it). The streaming path
                           gets the trailing run only, because Stage 1 trims
                           left_context/right_holdback BY FRAME COUNT and
                           dropping a leading or interior frame would desync
                           those trims and cut real speech. So a patched server
                           returns audio whose tail is already clean and THE
                           CLIENT MUST NOT TRIM AGAIN. What remains is a hard
                           sample boundary, which is a click: `edge_fade` -
                           EdgeFade(10 in, 25 out) - is the assembler's job.
                           SUPERSEDES work/patch_tail_trim.py (retired
                           2026-09-05), which reasoned about WHERE sentinels
                           usually sit and kept the 0-substitution for every one
                           outside the trailing run.

Both belong in a managed-env recipe at cut-over; see ../PORT_NOTES.md 12.7.

WHAT THE REQUEST LOOKS LIKE, and the two ways it goes silently wrong:

  * SAMPLING MUST RIDE IN `extra_params`. `temperature` / `top_p` / `top_k` are
    not fields of `OpenAICreateSpeechRequest`; pydantic drops them without a
    word, and the whole first audition therefore ran at the server default
    while reporting 0.3. AND "the server default" IS THE MODEL DIRECTORY:
    sending nothing means whatever `<model dir>/generation_config.json` holds,
    because `--generation-config` defaults to `auto` and `serve_v3.sh` passes no
    override. A validated merged checkpoint holds temperature 1.0, top_p 0.95,
    top_k 50, repetition_penalty 1.0; a directory WITHOUT the file - which is
    every unmerged `bosonai/higgs-audio-v3-tts-4b` snapshot - gets a bare
    `SamplingParams()` instead: top_p 1.0 and top_k DISABLED, the untruncated
    1026-way codebook tail, which derails long chunks into babble. See
    `require_generation_config` and ../PORT_NOTES.md 12.8d. So base weights are
    sent `SERVER_DEFAULT_SAMPLING` EXPLICITLY (HiggsV3Config.served_sampling)
    and only a checkpoint voice sends nothing.
  * A CONTROL TOKEN THAT IS NOT IN THE VOCABULARY IS READ ALOUD AS WORDS and
    derails generation into a degenerate loop - ASR coverage 0.000, pitch std
    0.28 st, speaker cosine 0.05. `<|emotion:calm|>`, `<|emotion:neutral|>`,
    `<|prosody:pause_long|>` and the v2-only `<|scene_desc_start|>` are all
    traps. Hence `validate_control_tokens`, run on every request.

EXACTLY ONE REFERENCE. vllm-omni refuses multi-shot cloning, so "two clips"
means ONE concatenated wav (clips joined by 0.35 s of silence) with the
transcripts joined in the same order - and the total is capped at 30 s (42 s is
HTTP 400 "Reference audio too long"). Measured: no reference 0.093 speaker
cosine, one clip 0.680, two clips 0.692, against a 0.766 narrator self-ceiling;
same-book vs cross-book is worth +0.076, the second clip only +0.012.

#: THIS IS NOT A FALLBACK. How narrator launches its Higgs v3 server is
#: narrator's own definition - the CUDA_HOME and FlashInfer workarounds, the
#: per-stage memory fractions and the certified frames-7500 deploy profile are
#: all in that file, and a client that has never heard of BookForge cannot be
#: expected to supply them. Until 2026-09-13 the only copy lived in BookForge's
#: `electron/scripts/higgs/`, so narrator refused to start at all for any other

#: owens-pc 2026-09-05: root = the base snapshot path when the launcher was
#: started without HIGGS_MODEL_DIR), and `running_checkpoint()` reads it. This
#: variable is the operator's assertion for a server build whose model list

#: the server reports - a reported path is a fact and an env var is a claim.
CHECKPOINT_ENV = served_common.CHECKPOINT_ENV
#: THE LAUNCH SCRIPT'S OWN KNOBS (`serve_higgs_v3.sh`), exported into the

#:   HIGGS_MODEL_DIR    the merged checkpoint the server comes up ON. Left
#:                      unset, the script serves the base snapshot - a
#:                      different speaker - and `check_serves_expected_model`
#:                      then (correctly) refuses after a 55-297 s launch.
#:                      That was Owen's first in-app Higgs render (2026-09-05).
#:   HIGGS_HOST/PORT    where the script binds, which must be where narrator
#:                      polls `/health` and posts renders.
#:   HIGGS_MAX_NUM_SEQS how many sequences stage 0 admits at once - and
#:                      therefore how wide narrator's own batch is

#: the pair it chose into the wrapper, so they cannot drift apart.
SERVE_DEFAULT_HOST = '127.0.0.1'
SERVE_DEFAULT_PORT = 8095
#: How the base snapshot is recognised in a reported model root: the HF cache
#: directory name of `bosonai/higgs-audio-v3-tts-4b`. A server whose root
#: carries this is serving the BASE weights; any other root is a fine-tune.
BASE_SNAPSHOT_MARKER = 'models--bosonai--higgs-audio-v3-tts-4b'
#: THE OWNERSHIP MARKER: exported into the launch wrapper's environment, and
#: therefore into `/proc/<pid>/environ` of the server and every process it
#: forks. Its value is the pid of the narrator process that launched it.
#:
#: This replaced a pid FILE holding the wrapper's `$!`. MEASURED 2026-09-05 on
#: Owen's first Windows render: `setsid bash serve_higgs_v3.sh &` recorded
#: 84072, but vllm-omni puts itself into a session of its own (84096 -> 84098,
#: sid 84098), so the recorded pid was dead within a second, `kill -TERM
#: -- -84072` was "No such process", and the server outlived the job holding
#: 24 GB. A pid remembered at launch cannot follow a process that re-parents
#: itself; a marker in its environment can, because environ is inherited by
#: every fork and exec and nothing in vllm-omni rewrites it. So a server is
#: OURS iff the process listening on our port carries this variable, and its
#: process GROUP (read off /proc/<pid>/stat, not remembered) is what a stop
#: signals - measured: the two `VLLM::StageEngineCoreProc` children share the
#: listener's pgid.
#: How long one guest-side command (a /proc scan, a group signal) may take
#: before it is reported as unanswered. Owen, 2026-09-05: "timeouts are intended
#: to kill something if its waiting for an obscenely long time ... it should be
#: like 10 minutes." These are wedge detectors, not budgets: a WSL VM that takes
#: a minute to answer under load is slow, not gone, and a 30 s ceiling turned
#: slow into "could not scan" on a healthy machine.

#: How long the guest-side watchdog sleeps between looks at the owner.
WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_SECONDS = served_common.WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_SECONDS

#: WHERE AN ATTACHED SERVER'S LOG IS, named by the operator. NO DEFAULT.
#:
#: In LAUNCH mode narrator owns the server's output and writes it itself (see
#: `server_log`), so this is not needed. In ATTACH mode the server belongs to
#: somebody else and its output went wherever they sent it; narrator cannot
#: discover that and will not guess, because the wrong file is worse than none -
#: a stale log from an earlier run would let the sentinel proof pass on evidence
#: from a server that is no longer up.
#:
#: The training side's own launcher tees to
#: `E:\\training\\_campaigns\\2026-09-01-cod-full-rebuild\\higgs\\v3_ft\\logs\\serve_current.log`,
#: OVERWRITTEN PER START, and that is the path an operator points this at when
#: attaching to their server. Give it in the form the READING process sees: a
#: narrator worker runs inside WSL, so that file is `/mnt/e/training/...` there.
SERVER_LOG_ENV = 'NARRATOR_HIGGS3_SERVER_LOG'

#: `vllm_omni/deploy/higgs_multimodal_qwen3.yaml` stage 0 - THE DEPLOY DEFAULT
#: FOR THE BASE WEIGHTS, and nothing more than that.
#:
#: It is NOT what a request gets by sending no `extra_params`. `vllm-omni serve`
#: on the CLI never reads that YAML; it resolves sampling from the MODEL
#: DIRECTORY (`--generation-config` defaults to `auto`), so an empty request
#: gets `<model dir>/generation_config.json` - and, when the directory has no
#: such file, a bare `SamplingParams()`: top_p 1.0, top_k DISABLED. The
#: `bosonai/higgs-audio-v3-tts-4b` snapshot ships no such file, which is why a
#: merged checkpoint must carry one (`require_generation_config`) and why base
#: weights are sent these values EXPLICITLY rather than assumed
#: (`HiggsV3Config.served_sampling`). See ../PORT_NOTES.md 12.8d.
#:
#: `seed` rides at the request's TOP LEVEL and never inside `extra_params`
#: (`build_request_body` refuses the duplicate), so it is excluded wherever this
#: mapping is used as a sampling payload.
SERVER_DEFAULT_SAMPLING = {'temperature': 1.0, 'top_p': 0.95, 'top_k': 50,
                           'repetition_penalty': 1.0, 'seed': 42}

#: The log file narrator writes a server it LAUNCHED to, inside the session's
#: process dir when there is one. narrator has no other log FILE anywhere - its
#: own engine lines go to a STREAM the host chooses (`engine/log.py`) - so this
#: is a new artifact, and it lives beside `session-state.json` because that is
#: the directory that already holds a run's own per-run files (the Orpheus
#: guards file their rejects there too). One per SESSION, overwritten per start,
#: exactly like the training side's `serve_current.log`.
SERVER_LOG_NAME = 'higgs-v3-server.log'

#: WHERE THE SENTINEL FILTER WRITES ITS RECORDS, and the one variable that makes
#: proof (a) a real channel instead of a log scrape.
#:
#: `electron/scripts/higgs/patch_sentinel_filter.py` v3 reads this out of its own
#: process environment at import and appends one JSON record per filter
#: invocation - clean ones included. narrator exports it into the launch wrapper
#: beside HIGGS_HOST/HIGGS_PORT/HIGGS_MODEL_DIR, so in LAUNCH mode the path the
#: server writes and the path narrator reads are decided in one place and cannot
#: name different files. In ATTACH mode narrator reads the variable out of its
#: OWN environment: an operator who started the server by hand states the same
#: file here that they gave it, exactly as they state its log in SERVER_LOG_ENV.
#: There is NO DEFAULT, for the same reason: a stale report from an earlier run
#: would let this proof pass on evidence from a server that is no longer up.
SENTINEL_REPORT_ENV = 'HIGGS_SENTINEL_REPORT'

#: The suffix narrator appends to `launch_log` to name the report it owns. It
#: rides beside the log deliberately: one per SESSION when the engine gave us a
#: process dir, one per INSTANCE otherwise, truncated at every launch - the same
#: three properties the log has, for the same reason (two workers must never
#: share one, and last run's evidence must never certify this run).
SENTINEL_REPORT_SUFFIX = '.sentinel.jsonl'

#: The record `v` this narrator reads. A record carrying any other version is
#: REFUSED rather than skipped: it means the env holds a patch generation this
#: code was not written against, and quietly ignoring the records would be the
#: "no evidence reads as no problem" failure this whole proof exists to prevent.
SENTINEL_REPORT_VERSION = 3

# ── THREE REGEXES OVER THE SERVER'S LOG FILE LIVED HERE UNTIL 2026-09-13 ─────
#
# `_ASYNC_SENTINEL_RE`, `_SYNC_INTERIOR_RE` and `_EMPTY_CHUNK_RE` matched the
# three `logger.warning` messages the sentinel filter can write, and
# `verify_sentinel_filter` opened the server's LOG FILE and ran them over every
# line to decide whether a 19 GB model could render a book. That is
# crucible/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md rule R4's headline example - a log line that
# became an API nothing versions and nothing tests. vLLM re-words a warning, or
# the log formatter changes, or the file rotates, and the proof either refuses a
# healthy server or, far worse, passes on nothing at all.
#
# It also carried a belief that was already FALSE. The deleted constant
# `EXPECTED_TRAILING_SENTINEL_FRAMES = 2` documented v1 of the patch, which
# counted out-of-range frames BEFORE it trimmed the trailing run and so counted
# the model's normal 2-frame EOC ramp. **v2 (2026-09-05) reordered exactly
# that**: it trims by identity first, so on a correct build the async warning
# does not fire on a clean final window at all. Against a v2 env the old proof
# therefore passed two different ways it should not have - vacuously, on a log
# with no matching lines, and on a log full of the very "2 frame(s)" lines v2
# exists to eliminate, because 2 was what it expected.
#
# The fix is at the SOURCE: patch v3 writes one structured record per filter
# invocation to `$HIGGS_SENTINEL_REPORT` (SENTINEL_REPORT_ENV), and
# `verify_sentinel_filter` reads records. The warnings are untouched and still
# go to the log for a human - R4's instruction is "promote the fact to an event",

#: chars). With the file present the same server renders the same prompts
#: correctly.

        1. The exports: the launch script's knobs and the OWNER marker

           is how `_server_on_port` tells OURS from a stranger's.
        2. `setsid bash <script> &` - the script detached from this shell's
           group so a signal to the wrapper never reaches the server by
           accident, and `wait` so this shell lives as long as the script.
           NO PID IS RECORDED HERE: vllm-omni re-sessions itself after exec
           (measured 84072 -> 84096 -> 84098), so `$!` is dead within a second
           of the server coming up. The listener on our port, found by
           `/proc/net/tcp` after `/health` answers, is the only pid worth
           knowing, and its group is read at the moment of the signal.
        3. THE WATCHDOG, on the guest arm only: a stdlib python3 process,
           detached with setsid, that watches the OWNER pid (this narrator
           worker) and, when it is gone, SIGTERMs the group of whatever is
           listening on our port WITH OUR MARKER - then waits for the port to
           free and exits. That is what makes "hit Stop" and "the app died"
           bring the server down: a worker killed with SIGKILL never runs its
           own cleanup, and until this existed the server outlived every such
           job holding 24 GB (Owen, 2026-09-05: "it should bring it down if i
           hit stop or if bookforge app dies"). The watchdog also exits on its
           own once no marked listener remains, so it never lingers. On the
           Windows arm the owner is a host pid the guest cannot see, so no
           watchdog is started and `stop()` is the only teardown - stated in
           OWNER_ENV's prefix, not guessed at.

        The other half, (b) "no one-frame trim left in the stage processor", is
        a static grep BookForge's doctor runs before any server starts. This is
        the half that needs the running decode path to say what it did.

        IT USED TO GREP THE SERVER'S LOG FILE. Three regexes over vLLM's
        formatted warnings decided whether a 19 GB model could render a book -
        crucible/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md R4's headline example, and a proof that
        could pass on nothing at all the moment a message was re-worded. Patch
        v3 (2026-09-13) now appends one JSON record per filter invocation to the
        file named in SENTINEL_REPORT_ENV, and this reads those records. The
        warnings still go to the log, unchanged, for a human to read.

        WHAT IS ASSERTED, and why each one:

          * THE REPORT EXISTS AND IS NOT EMPTY. No report, an unreadable one, or
            one with zero records is a REFUSAL. The filter records EVERY
            invocation including clean ones, so an empty file means the decode
            path did not run, or ran in an env whose patch predates the report -
            and "no evidence" must never read as "no problem". THIS IS THE
            ASSERTION THE LOG-GREP VERSION COULD NOT MAKE: a log with no
            matching lines was indistinguishable from a clean render, and it
            passed.
          * EVERY RECORD IS THIS VERSION. A record carrying any `v` but
            SENTINEL_REPORT_VERSION is an env holding a patch generation this
            code was not written against; skipping it would be the same silent
            pass by another route.
          * ZERO SYNC-PATH INTERIOR DROPS. The sync path takes the FULL filter,
            so an interior drop there is a frame that failed the token test
            while sitting between two good ones - not an expected shape on any
            real generation, and never observed offline. One is a refusal.
          * ZERO EMPTY CHUNKS (a sync record whose `kept` is 0): every frame of
            that chunk carried a stream sentinel, so it produced no audio at all.
          * ZERO OUT-OF-RANGE FRAMES LEFT ON A FINAL ASYNC WINDOW. This is the
            assertion the old one was groping for and had backwards. Patch v2
            removes the trailing sentinel run BY IDENTITY before it counts, so
            on the FINAL window anything still out of range is a sentinel the
            trim could not reach - and it was then substituted with codec code
            0, a VALID code that decodes to real, audible sound on the end of
            that chunk. The old check expected exactly `2` there, which is what
            v1 printed and what v2 exists to eliminate.
          * A NON-FINAL window's leftovers are COUNTED, NOT REFUSED. There they
            can only be the left-context region Stage 1 discards by frame count
            anyway (patch_sentinel_filter.py, async step 2). The count is
            returned so a ledger can carry it; it is not evidence of damage, and
            refusing on it would fail correct servers.

        put it in a ledger.

        WHAT THIS NO LONGER DOES: prove `work/patch_sentinel_filter.py` is
        applied. It used to (as `probe_tail_trim`), because an unpatched server
        left ~240 ms of decoded sentinel garbage on the end of every chunk at
        about -30 dB and a quiet tail was therefore evidence. Under the sentinel
        filter the trailing frames are GONE rather than quiet, so the window
        holds ordinary speech decay: -35 to -38 dBFS on the certifying box, on
        the patched and the band-aided build alike (measured 2026-09-05). A
        level gate here would now fail correct servers and could never separate
        the two builds. Keeping it would have been a number defended for its own
        sake.

        WHAT WOULD PROVE THE PATCH, both halves measured by the fine-tuning
        session:

          (a) THE SERVER'S OWN LOG, READ. `verify_sentinel_filter` - DONE
              2026-09-05, and the reason `start()` no longer sends the
              launcher's streams to DEVNULL. It counts the trailing-ramp lines
              (every one must report exactly
              EXPECTED_TRAILING_SENTINEL_FRAMES = 2; any other count is a
              sentinel the trim did not reach) and refuses a single SYNC-path
              interior drop - a frame that failed the token test between two
              good ones, which offline classification of every saved talker
              matrix puts at zero on all real shapes and which the detector has
              never fired on. A missing or unreadable log is itself a refusal:
              the proof IS the stream.
          (b) NO TRIM CODE LEFT IN THE STAGE PROCESSOR. `[:, :-1]` occurs twice
              in the pristine `higgs_audio_v3.py` and zero times after the
              patch. This half IS enforced today, statically and before any
              server starts: BookForge's Higgs doctor greps the file in
              site-packages for `_filter_sentinel_frames` AND for the absence of
              `[:, :-1]`, and reports `trim-survived` for a half-applied or
              stacked file (electron/tool-paths.ts HIGGS_PATCHES,
              electron/scripts/higgs/install_higgs_env.sh).

        NOT A FAILURE: the async warning at higgs_audio_v3.py:403 ("frame(s)
        carry a stream sentinel outside the trailing run") is an INSTRUMENTATION
        BUG in the patch - the count is taken BEFORE the trailing-run trim, so it
        counts the normal 2-frame EOC ramp. Expect exactly "2 frame(s)" per
        chunk, in sequential renders as much as concurrent ones. COUNT them and
        report the count; do not read them as contamination.

        Cost: one ~1 s generation, once per server start. Returns the dBFS.
