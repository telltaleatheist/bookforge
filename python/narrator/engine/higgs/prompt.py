"""The Higgs chat history: reference clips ARE the voice.

Ported from the measured harness
`E:\\training\\_campaigns\\2026-09-01-cod-full-rebuild\\higgs\\render_v2.py`
(`build_conv`, 2026-09-04) - the run that produced the deathstalker audition,
not the model card. The template it renders is recorded verbatim in that
campaign's HIGGS_NOTES.md section A and is reproduced in this module's
constants so a test can pin it without the model.

WHAT THE CONVERSATION LOOKS LIKE (2 reference clips, one target chunk):

    system     "Generate audio following instruction."
    scene      "Audio is recorded from a quiet room."
    user       <REF-1 TRANSCRIPT>
    assistant  {"type": "audio", "url": <REF-1 WAV>}
    user       <REF-2 TRANSCRIPT>
    assistant  {"type": "audio", "url": <REF-2 WAV>}
    user       <TARGET TEXT>
    (+ add_generation_prompt -> a trailing assistant turn opened with
       <|audio_out_bos|>)

`scene` is a FIRST-CLASS ROLE in Higgs v2, not a control token: the processor
renders it into the system block between `<|scene_desc_start|>` (128018) and
`<|scene_desc_end|>` (128019). Higgs v3 has NO scene-description token at all,
which is why the scene lives on the voice and not on this module.

THE REFERENCE AUDIO IS NOT TEXT. `<|AUDIO_OUT|>` (128016) is a placeholder in
the text stream marking where the processor splices in a PARALLEL audio-token
stream; the clip is encoded by the audio tokenizer into `audio_input_ids`
(shape (batch, frames, 8)). 732 frames == 28.5 s of reference in the measured
run, so reference length is paid for in context.

Nothing here imports torch or transformers: it builds the plain list of dicts
`processor.apply_chat_template` takes.

    (`SML_UNSPOKEN_PATTERN`, ported from e2a conf_models.py). It lives in the
    Orpheus port's text module today because that is where it landed; it belongs
    in `narrator/text/` once that exists, and this import is the one place it
    would have to change.

    scripture rewriting. Number normalization is a BookForge model pass over the
    narration copy and is not repeated here (Owen, 2026-09-02, permanently).
    Higgs v3 additionally REFUSES an unknown `<|...|>` control token before it
    reaches the model - see v3_served.validate_control_tokens - because an
    unknown one is read aloud rather than ignored.
